/**
 * Exception-throwing wrappers around libssh2 functions.
 *
 * This wrapper functions in this namespace adhere to the following
 * restrictions:
 *
 * - The behaviour is identical to that of the wrapped function except
 *   that the range of possible return values (via return or
 *   out-parameter) may be reduced by substituting them for
 *   exceptions.  Additionally, an error code and message out-parameter
 *   may be set to have a value.
 *
 * - The signature, including the return type, exactly matches the
 *   signature of the wrapped function, with three exceptions:
 *
 *   + it may include additional parameters (such as a session pointer)
 *     that are not in the original signature in order to fetch or return
 *     error details.
 *   + if the range of return values is reduced (see above) such that
 *     the remaining values simply indicate success, the return type
 *     may be changed to `void`.
 *
 * - As a consequence of the previous restrictions, any resources that
 *   need freeing when returned by the wrapped function, also need
 *   freeing after calling the wrapped version.
 *
 * - No references to the arguments are stored once the wrapper
 *   terminates, whether that termination is by return or by
 *   exception.  In particular, the exceptions thrown contain
 *   no shared data.
 *
 * - It is permitted to call these functions from within code that is
 *   non-recursively locked on the given session.  Therefore no
 *   coordination of concurrent threads of execution is performed by
 *   the wrappers and only one thread may call these wrapper functions
 *   (or an libssh2 function) with the same session at any time.
 *
 * Any function not able to adhere to these restrictions is not
 * eligible for inclusion in this namespace.
 *
 * Rationale
 * ---------
 *
 * The main reason for keeping these wrappers here is to make sure any
 * locking we introduce in the future for thread-safety spans both the
 * function call and the code to retrieve any error.  This is necessary
 * as otherwise the exception thrown may be from an error caused by
 * another thread's call to a function with the same session (only the
 * details of one error are stored per session).
 *
 * This namespace defines a boundary beyond which all functions behave
 * in the way defined here.  This makes it easier to keep track of
 * session lifetimes as well as where to (and not to) lock the
 * session.
