         *    c) without needing to call the responder.  Scary.

         *    a) even though the responder executed completely. E.g. the user
         *       gave the wrong response.
         *    b) because the responder threw an exception and the server
         *       rejected the (possibly partially-complete) responses.
         *    c) without needing to call the responder, e.g. kb-interactive not
         *       set up properly on the server (yes, this does actually happen,
         *       we tested it - e.g the cygwin server).
         * (3) Some other failure occurred:
         *    a) even though the responder executed completely.
         *    b) the responder threw an exception but the failure is unrelated
         *       (because it's not possible to abort, it must be unrelated).

     * @param username
     *     UTF-8 string identifying the user to authenticate as.
     * @param responder
     *     Callback to receive the challenges from the server and provide the
     *     corresponding responses.
     *     The callback must be a model of the `ChallengeResponder` concept.
     *     That means it must be callable with a three arguments:
     *      - a string giving the challenge title (may be empty),
     *      - a string giving the challenge instructions (may be empty), and
     *      - a range of zero or more prompts, each a pair whose first member
     *        is the prompt text and whose second member is a boolean indicating
     *        whether the response should be obscured like a password or made
     *        visible.
     *     The call must return a range of responses as strings, one for every
     *     prompt in the same order as the prompts.
     *
     * @returns
     *     `true` if authentication successful, `false` if the server positively
     *      rejected the responses produced by the `responder` callback.
     *
     * @throws `boost::system::system_error`
     *     if unexpected failure while trying to authenticate or if the server
     *     positively rejects authentication without even calling the
     *     `responder`.
     * @throws user-defined-exception
     *     if authentication fails because the `responder` threw an exception,
     *     the exception is throw out of this method.
     *
     * @warning  The responder __must not__ call any code that uses the same
     *           SSH session currently being authenticated.  Doing so results
     *           in undefined behaviour (likely deadlock).
